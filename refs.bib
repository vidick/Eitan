abstract = {A central tool in constructing pseudorandom generators, secure encryption functions, and in other areas are “hard-core” predicates b of functions (permutations) undefined, discovered in [Blum Micali 82]. Such b(x) cannot be efficiently guessed (substantially better than 50-50) given only undefined(x). Both b, undefined are computable in polynomial time.[Yao 82] transforms any one-way function undefined into a more complicated one, undefined*, which has a hard-core predicate. The construction applies the original undefined to many small pieces of the input to undefined* just to get one “hard-core” bit. The security of this bit may be smaller than any constant positive power of the security of undefined. In fact, for inputs (to undefined*) of practical size, the pieces effected by undefined are so small that undefined can be inverted (and the “hard-core” bit computed) by exhaustive search.In this paper we show that every one-way function, padded to the form undefined(p, x) = (p, g(x)), ‖‖p‖‖ = ‖x‖, has by itself a hard-core predicate of the same (within a polynomial) security. Namely, we prove a conjecture of [Levin 87, sec. 5.6.2] that the scalar product of Boolean vectors p, x is a hard-core of every one-way function undefined(p, x) = (p, g(x)). The result extends to multiple (up to the logarithm of security) such bits and to any distribution on the x's for which undefined is hard to invert.},

title = {Device-independent two-party cryptography secure against sequential attacks},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The goal of two-party cryptography is to enable two parties, Alice and Bob, to solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks are private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum communication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage model by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time frame. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent (DI) protocols for two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a relatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known as weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the protocol are prepared by the dishonest party. DI two-party cryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust each other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully analyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are optimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key ingredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit (and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against Bob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice’s setting (guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that security is possible for arbitrarily small violation.}

abstract="We investigate the Goldreich-Levin Theorem in the context of quantum information. This result is a reduction from the problem of inverting a one-way function to the problem of predicting a particular bit associated with that function. We show that the quantum version of the reduction is quantitatively more efficient than the known classical version. If the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in the reduction is by a factor of O(n/$\epsilon$2) in the classical case but only by a factor of O(1/$\epsilon$) in the quantum case, where 1/2 +$\epsilon$ is the probability of predicting the hard-predicate. We also show that, using the Goldreich- Levin Theorem, a quantum bit (or qubit) commitment scheme that is perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any quantum one-way permutation.",
